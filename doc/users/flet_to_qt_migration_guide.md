## Configuration Migration

### Step 1: Backup Existing Configuration

```bash
# Backup Flet configuration (if you customized it)
cp ~/.bmlibrarian/config.json ~/.bmlibrarian/config.json.flet_backup
```

### Step 2: Agent Configuration (No Changes Required)

The agent configuration (`~/.bmlibrarian/config.json`) is **fully compatible** between Flet and Qt. No migration needed.

If you customized agent settings in Flet, they will work identically in Qt.

### Step 3: GUI Configuration (New File)

Qt introduces a new GUI configuration file: `~/.bmlibrarian/gui_config.json`

**Default configuration** (created automatically on first launch):

```json
{
  "gui": {
    "theme": "default",
    "window": {
      "width": 1400,
      "height": 900,
      "remember_geometry": true,
      "x": null,
      "y": null,
      "maximized": false
    },
    "tabs": {
      "enabled_plugins": [
        "research",
        "search",
        "configuration",
        "fact_checker",
        "query_lab"
      ],
      "tab_order": [
        "research",
        "search",
        "fact_checker",
        "query_lab",
        "configuration"
      ],
      "default_tab": "research"
    },
    "research_tab": {
      "show_workflow_steps": true,
      "auto_scroll_to_active": true,
      "max_documents_display": 100
    },
    "search_tab": {
      "max_results": 100,
      "show_abstracts": true
    },
    "fact_checker_tab": {
      "auto_save": true,
      "show_confidence_timer": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Customize as Needed

**Enable Dark Theme**:
```json
{
  "gui": {
    "theme": "dark"
  }
}
```

**Disable Tabs You Don't Use**:
```json
{
  "gui": {
    "tabs": {
      "enabled_plugins": [
        "research",
        "configuration"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Change Default Tab**:
```json
{
  "gui": {
    "tabs": {
      "default_tab": "search"
    }
  }
}
```

## Workflow Differences

**Status**: Both GUIs available

- ✅ Qt GUI is feature-complete
- ✅ Flet GUI still works (deprecated)
- ⚠️ New features only in Qt GUI
- ⚠️ Flet bugs only fixed if critical

**Recommendation**: Start using Qt GUI now

### Phase 2: Deprecation (Mar 2025 - Apr 2025)

**Status**: Flet GUI deprecated

- ⚠️ Flet GUI shows deprecation warning on launch
- ⚠️ No Flet bug fixes
- ✅ Qt GUI is default/recommended

**Recommendation**: Complete migration to Qt GUI

### Phase 3: Removal (May 2025)

**Status**: Flet GUI removed

- ❌ Flet code removed from repository
- ❌ `bmlibrarian_research_gui.py` no longer available
- ❌ `bmlibrarian_config_gui.py` no longer available
- ❌ `fact_checker_review_gui.py` no longer available
- ✅ Only Qt GUI available

**Recommendation**: Must use Qt GUI

## Troubleshooting

### "I prefer the Flet GUI"

**Issue**: You're more comfortable with the old interface

**Solution**: Give Qt GUI a fair trial. Common concerns:

- **"It looks different"**: Yes, but more professional and native
- **"I don't like tabs"**: You can disable tabs you don't use
- **"Keyboard shortcuts are confusing"**: You don't have to use them
- **"It's slower"**: Actually, Qt is faster! Give it time.

### Configuration Not Working

**Issue**: Settings from Flet don't apply in Qt

**Solution**:
1. Verify `~/.bmlibrarian/config.json` exists
2. Agent settings are shared, GUI settings are separate
3. Check `~/.bmlibrarian/gui_config.json` for GUI settings
4. Reset to defaults if needed (delete config files)

### Missing Features

**Issue**: Can't find a feature from Flet

**Solution**: All Flet features are in Qt:

- **Research workflow**: Research tab
- **Configuration**: Configuration tab
- **Fact-checker**: Fact-Checker tab
- **Query Lab**: Query Lab tab
- **Document search**: Search tab (new!)

If you genuinely can't find a feature, please report it.

### Performance Issues

**Issue**: Qt GUI seems slower than Flet

**Solution**:
1. Check Ollama is running properly
2. Verify database connection
3. Try with fewer documents/results
4. Check logs: `~/.bmlibrarian/gui_qt.log`

Qt should be **faster** than Flet. If not, something is wrong.

### File Dialog Crashes (macOS)

**Issue**: Experienced crashes with Flet file picker

**Solution**: **This is fixed in Qt!** File dialogs use native Qt dialogs that are stable on macOS.

### Dark Theme Not Applying

**Issue**: Dark theme selected but doesn't work

**Solution**:
1. Edit `~/.bmlibrarian/gui_config.json`:
   ```json
   {"gui": {"theme": "dark"}}
   ```
2. Restart application (required for theme change)
