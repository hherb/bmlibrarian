## Findings

Optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) is a noninvasive surrogate marker for intracranial pressure (ICP). In adult populations, a cut‑off value exceeding 5.7 mm has been reported to indicate raised ICP [1]. A recent receiver‑operator characteristic (ROC) analysis refined this threshold to 5.205 mm, achieving 95.8 % sensitivity and 80.4 % specificity for detecting elevated ICP [2]. In pediatric cohorts, the optimal ONSD threshold is lower; a recent ROC study identified 4.46 mm as the cut‑off, with an area under the curve of 0.906 (95 % CI 0.844–0.968), 85.3 % sensitivity and 86.4 % specificity [3]. Moreover, age‑specific ultrasonographic thresholds have been proposed: infants >4.0 mm, children 1–10 years >4.71 mm, and adolescents >10 years >5.43 mm, which together yielded a sensitivity of 100 % and specificity ranging from 60 % to 66.7 % for diagnosing raised ICP [4]. These findings underscore the importance of tailoring ONSD cut‑offs to patient age and highlight the technique’s potential as a rapid, bedside tool for ICP assessment.
