    Exercise and Cardiovascular Health: A Meta-Analysis
    
    Background: Physical activity has been widely promoted for cardiovascular health benefits.
    
    Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 45 randomized controlled 
    trials involving 125,000 participants. Studies were included if they examined the effects 
    of structured exercise programs on cardiovascular outcomes.
    
    Results: Regular aerobic exercise was associated with a 35% reduction in cardiovascular 
    disease risk (RR=0.65, 95% CI: 0.58-0.73, p<0.001). The benefits were consistent across 
    all age groups, with stronger effects observed in participants over 60 years old. 
    High-intensity interval training showed superior results compared to moderate continuous exercise.
    
    Conclusions: Structured exercise programs provide substantial cardiovascular protection 
    across all populations. The benefits appear to be dose-dependent and universal. 
    Healthcare providers should recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity 
    exercise per week for optimal cardiovascular protection.
