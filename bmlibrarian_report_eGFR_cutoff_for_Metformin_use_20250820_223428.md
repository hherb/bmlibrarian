## Research Question

> eGFR cutoff for Metformin use safety

## Evidence Assessment

- **Evidence Strength:** Moderate
- **Citations Analyzed:** 3
- **Unique References:** 3

## Findings

Current evidence indicates that metformin can be safely administered when the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is ≥45 mL/min/1.73 m², whereas initiation should be withheld for eGFR values between 30 and 44 mL/min/1.73 m², and the drug is contraindicated when eGFR falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [1,2]. For patients already receiving metformin with eGFR in the 30–44 mL/min/1.73 m² range, a daily dose of ≤1,000 mg is advised to mitigate risk [1]. In patients with an eGFR of 15–29 mL/min/1.73 m², a reduced daily dose of 500 mg is recommended to keep drug concentrations below safety thresholds [3]. These dosing recommendations collectively aim to balance glycaemic control with renal safety, and adherence to these thresholds is essential to minimize the risk of lactic acidosis while maintaining therapeutic efficacy.
