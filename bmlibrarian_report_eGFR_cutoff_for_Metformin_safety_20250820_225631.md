## Research Question

> eGFR cutoff for Metformin safety

## Evidence Assessment

- **Evidence Strength:** Moderate
- **Citations Analyzed:** 3
- **Unique References:** 3

## Findings

Metformin can be safely administered when the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is ≥45 mL/min/1.73 m² [1,2]. However, when eGFR falls below this threshold, specific dosing adjustments become necessary. For eGFR values between 30 and 44 mL/min/1.73 m², initiation of metformin is contraindicated, and if the drug is already prescribed, the daily dose should be capped at ≤1,000 mg; eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m² constitutes a contraindication [1]. In patients with eGFR of 15–29 mL/min/1.73 m², a reduced dose of 500 mg daily is recommended to keep drug concentrations within safe limits [3], thereby allowing continued use while minimizing the risk of accumulation. Thus, careful assessment of renal function is essential to guide metformin therapy and ensure patient safety.

## Counterfactual Analysis

**Original Confidence Level:** MEDIUM

### Main Claims Analyzed

1. Metformin can be safely administered when eGFR is ≥45 mL/min/1.73 m².
2. Metformin initiation is contraindicated for eGFR between 30 and 44 mL/min/1.73 m².
3. For eGFR between 30 and 44 mL/min/1.73 m², the daily dose of metformin should be capped at ≤1,000 mg if already prescribed.
4. Metformin is contraindicated for eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m².
5. A reduced dose of 500 mg daily of metformin is recommended for patients with eGFR of 15–29 mL/min/1.73 m² to minimize accumulation risk.

### Research Questions for Contradictory Evidence

#### High Priority Questions

**Question 1:** Are there patient populations (e.g., elderly, specific ethnicities, those with comorbidities like heart failure) where the risk-benefit profile of metformin differs significantly at eGFR levels between 30-44 mL/min/1.73 m²?

*Target Claim:* Metformin initiation is contraindicated for eGFR between 30 and 44 mL/min/1.73 m².

*Reasoning:* The document presents general guidelines. Specific populations might have altered pharmacokinetics or increased susceptibility to adverse effects (like lactic acidosis) even within the stated eGFR range, potentially invalidating the 'contraindicated for initiation' or 'cap at 1000mg' recommendations.

*Search Keywords:* metformin, eGFR, adverse events, elderly, comorbidities, lactic acidosis

**Question 2:** What is the incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin at eGFR levels between 30-44 mL/min/1.73 m² compared to those with eGFR ≥45 mL/min/1.73 m²?

*Target Claim:* Metformin initiation is contraindicated for eGFR between 30 and 44 mL/min/1.73 m².

*Reasoning:* The document implies a significant safety difference at the 30-44 threshold, primarily related to lactic acidosis risk. Directly comparing the incidence of this specific adverse event across these eGFR groups is crucial for validating the contraindication/dose cap.

*Search Keywords:* metformin, eGFR, lactic acidosis, incidence, risk

---

#### Medium Priority Questions

**Question 1:** Do studies using different methods for estimating eGFR (e.g., cystatin C-based vs. creatinine-based) yield different safety or efficacy outcomes for metformin at the specified eGFR cutoffs?

*Target Claim:* Metformin can be safely administered when eGFR is ≥45 mL/min/1.73 m².

*Search Keywords:* eGFR, metformin, cystatin C, creatinine, accuracy, safety

**Question 2:** Are there clinical trials or observational studies demonstrating safety and efficacy of metformin initiation or continuation at eGFR levels below 30 mL/min/1.73 m² under specific monitoring protocols?

*Target Claim:* Metformin is contraindicated for eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m².

*Search Keywords:* metformin, eGFR, safety, efficacy, low dose, monitoring

#### Low Priority Questions

**Question 1:** Does the duration of metformin use influence the risk of adverse events at lower eGFR levels (e.g., 30-44 mL/min/1.73 m²)?

### Overall Assessment

The document provides standard guidelines based on consensus statements, but relies on a limited number of citations. The evidence strength is rated as 'Moderate', suggesting potential for conflicting data or nuances not captured. The guidelines are general and may not apply universally across all patient populations or clinical contexts. The methodology described ('evidence synthesis based on 3 citations') is vague and lacks detail on the search strategy or inclusion/exclusion criteria.
